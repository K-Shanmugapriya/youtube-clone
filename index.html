  </h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a national holiday in India commemorating the nation's
    independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the 1947 Indian Independence
    Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained
    King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the nation adopted the Constitution of
    India on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India,
    with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the
    Independence Movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.
    <br>&emsp;The land of Vedas, India has been the home to many great political minds. The likes of Chanakya, Swami
    Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi have been born on this ancient land. The ideologies of these leaders have inspired
    millions across the globe. Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of non-violence and Satyagraha served as the two important
    pillars on which the country won its independence. The contribution of other famous freedom fighters like Subash
    Chandra Bose, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Sarojini Naidu, is engraved in golden letters in the Indian history. While Sardar
    Vallabhbhai Patel, who is referred to as the ‘Iron Man of India’ was involved in the formation of the states which
    constitute the present India, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was the brains behind the mammoth constitution of the country. The
    legacy of Gandhi was carried forward by the leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Jayprakash Narayan
    and Indira Gandhi, The leaders had a mammoth task of leading the country on the path of economic sustainability and
    it was only under their guidance that the country steered onto the path of advancement.</br>
